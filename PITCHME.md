### Why are we making the same mistakes?

---
### Historically...
@ul[squares]
- Security aligned most closely with ops
- Security has never had a settled place
- Security was a backstop to prevent "bad" releases
- People tried to avoid security (and could!)
@ulend

---
### ...today
@ul[squares]
- You can't avoid security
- Interaction has been forced
- Lack of understanding and communication
- Security requirements are  more engrained in law
- Security abusing its position

### DevSecOps to the rescue!

---
### Security needs to change
@ul[squares]
- Need to work with, not against
- Need to fit how dev and ops work 
- Need to be involved throughout the lifecycle
- Need to be accessible
@ulend

---
### Barriers to adoption
@ul[squares]
- Lack of skilled security professionals
- Lack of dev and ops with security knowledge
- Change is hard!

### Moving forward in your organisation

---
### Questions to ask throughout
@ul[squares]
- Is it secure?
- How do you know it's secure?
- Is it more or less secure than previously?
- Would you be happy using it?
@ulend

---
### Security need to provide requirements
@ul[squares]
- Configuration standards
- Coding standards
- Regulatory standards
- Ideally in a format that isn't a 300 page document!
- CIS Benchmarks (and linked tooling) can solve this.

### Threat Modelling

---
### Threat Modelling
@ul[squares]
- Anybody can pick it up
- Template threat models out the box
- Good collaboration opportunity
- Auto-generate threats
- As capability matures, introduce custom threats
@ulend

---
### Scan as part of builds, not just on deploy
@ul[squares]
- Static Analysis
- Dynamic Analysis
- Vulnerability Scanning
