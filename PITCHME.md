### Why are we making the same mistakes?

---
### Historically...
@ul[]
- Security aligns most closely with ops
- Security has never had a settled place in an organisation
- Seen as the "Work Prevention Unit"
- Acted as a backstop to prevent "bad" work being released
- People tried to avoid security (and could!)
@ulend

### ...today
@ul[]
- You can't avoid security
- This has forced interaction
