### Why are we making the same mistakes?

---
### Historically...
@ul[squares]
- Security aligned most closely with ops
- Security has never had a settled place in an organisation
- Acted as a backstop to prevent "bad" work being released
- People tried to avoid security (and could!)
@ulend

---
### ...today
@ul[squares]
- You can't avoid security
- Interaction has been forced
- Lack of understanding and communication on both sides
- Security requirements are becoming more engrained in law
- Security abusing its position

### DevSecOps to the rescue!

---
### Security needs to change
@ul[squares]
- Need to work with, not against
- Need to fit how dev and ops work 
- Need to be involved throughout the lifecycle
- Need to be accessible

---
### Barriers to adoption
@ul[squares]
- Lack of skilled security professionals
- Lack of dev and ops with security knowledge
- Change is hard!
